I find that everage has been brought up.Deviation drops by 0.1.All the minimum value rise up, while minimum blue number dramatically rise and that bring out the bluish part hidden in the image and this is because the original image has a lot of red value.This bring the blue curve up.Average is 0.1 higher.The maximum value does not change all the way.
